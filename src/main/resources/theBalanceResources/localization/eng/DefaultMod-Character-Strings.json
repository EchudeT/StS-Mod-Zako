      "A cocky young lady who treats the Spire as her playground, looking down on everyone else as \"small fries\". NL As long as she has coins to throw and insults to hurl, there's no problem she can't solve... probably?",
      "NL Facing the pulsating, filthy core, you sneer with utmost contempt. NL \"Is *this* the center of the Spire? What a shabby, disgusting heart. Let *me* 'liquidate' all the debts you've racked up until now~\"",
      "Navigating the unlit streets, you come across several hooded figures performing a dark ritual. As you approach, they turn towards you in unison. The tallest among them bares fanged teeth and extends a pale, long hand towards you. NL ~\"Join~ ~us,~ ~arrogant~ ~child...~ ~Feel~ ~the~ ~Spire's~ ~eternal~ ~and~ ~cold~ ~warmth.\"~"
